CraftNY Dev Challenge

Notes:

The challenge is pretty straight-forward and the instructions are easy to follow. I will have more time to work on the challenge in the coming days, if necessary. Please let me know.

With more time, I would have tried to add the animation to indicate when a post has been favorited already. I also would have tried to make it more responsive for smaller screens. And I would have liked to add tests to the project.

Overall it was pretty cool working on it.

Thank you for the opportunity!
